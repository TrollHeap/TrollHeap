## Hi there, I'm TrollHeap.

**Systems & Fullstack Developer**, focused on modern computing architectures, low-level Linux internals, and highly optimized CLI-first workflows.

> _“I don’t memorize — I model. I learn systems by breaking them apart and reassembling them.”_

Dual Bachelor's in Software Engineering and Computer Science

Passionate about:
- **Systems programming** with `Rust`, `C`, and `Bash`,
- High-performance **Backend development** in `PHP`, `Typescript`, `Python`, `Rust(Tauri)`
- Building fast, minimal **Linux-based development environments**. Understanding **Unix-like operating systems from kernel to userspace**.

Working daily on **Fedora/Rhel/Rocky linux**, in CLI-first setups, focused on **efficiency, reproducibility**, and **systemic design**.

### 🔍 Current Focus
- Writing **system daemons and tools** in Rust and Bash
- Mastering **Linux processes, threads, and memory subsystems**
- Building bridges between **Rust and Linux primitives** (mmap, signals, threads, etc.)
- Designing **zero-dependency CLI tools and portable scripts**
